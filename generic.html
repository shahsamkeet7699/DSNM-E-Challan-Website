									<p>The Global status report by WHO on road safety reaffirms our understanding of road traffic injuries as a global health and development problem. More than <strong> 1.2 million </strong> people die on the world’s roads every year, and as many as <strong>50 million</strong> others are injured. Over <strong>90%</strong> of the deaths occur in <strong>low-income and middle-income countries</strong>.</p>
									<p>With the Global status report on road safety, we have for the first time an assessment on the status of road safety around the globe. This unique and comparable set of data confirms the relevance of this issue to the societal challenges of today. It identifies clear gaps and opportunities and inspires us to action.</p>
									<p>The WHO Global Burden of Disease project, which uses vital registration (death certificate) data irrespective of the time period between collision and death, estimates that <strong>1.27 million people die as a result of a road traffic collision annually</strong>.</p>

								<p> The total number of deaths reported in this survey is approximately 6,60,000 (using a 30-day definition), indicating vast under-reporting. When these data are modelled, the total 30-day number for the 178 countries included in the study is 1.23 million. Almost all data sources show that about <strong>three-quarters of road traffic deaths are among men</strong> and that the<strong> highest impact is in the economically active age ranges</strong>. Based on modelled numbers, the 10 countries with the highest number of deaths are: China, <strong>India</strong>, Nigeria, the United States, Pakistan, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, Brazil, Egypt and Ethiopia. Unless proper action is taken, road traffic injuries are predicted to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030.</p>
